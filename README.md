# IT Support Training

This is a collection of my notes from Google's IT Support Professionial Certificate. I will take these notes and create Anki flash cards from them to get my spaced repetition in. After each section I recall what I've learned and dive deeper into any topics that interest me. This helps me with my Active Recall.
