# Week 3 The transport and application layers

`What does the transport layer do?`
* Allows traffic to be directed to specific network applications.

`What is the application layer and what does it do?`
* Allows applications to communicate in a way they understand.

`What is multiplexing/demultiplexing in the transport layer?`
* Multiplexing means that nodes on the network have the ability to
  direct traffic toward many different receiving services.
* Demultiplexing is the same concept, except on the receiving end, its
  taking traffic that's all aimed at the same node and delivering it to
  the proper receiving service.

`What is a port?`
* A 16-bit number that's used to direct traffic to specific services
  running on a networked computer. The transport layer used ports to
  multiplex/demultiplex

`What is a socket address/socket number?`
* An IP address written with a port in it, denoted with a colon
  10.0.0.1**:80**
